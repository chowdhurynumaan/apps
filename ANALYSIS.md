# Repository Analysis: File Relationships and Dependencies

This document outlines the architecture, file relationships, and data dependencies of the class-tracker application.

## Core Application Files

The main application consists of three core, standalone HTML files: `index.html`, `dashboard.html`, and `quran-tracker.html`.

### 1. `index.html` (Attendance Tracker)

*   **Purpose:** The primary data entry point for daily class attendance and progress reports.
*   **External Dependencies:** Tailwind CSS, Google Fonts, and Firebase SDK (v10.10.0), all loaded from CDNs.
*   **Inter-File Links:** Contains a shared navigation menu with links to `dashboard.html` and `quran-tracker.html`.
*   **Data Dependencies (Firebase):**
    *   **Reads and Writes:** It is the primary **producer** of attendance data, writing to the `daily_attendance_reports` and `accumulated_class_scores` collections. It also reads and writes user information from the `users` collection.
    *   **Reads:** It reads shared configuration data from `class_definitions` and admin settings.

### 2. `dashboard.html` (Dashboard)

*   **Purpose:** A data visualization and analytics dashboard that provides insights into the attendance data generated by `index.html`.
*   **External Dependencies:** Tailwind CSS, Google Fonts, Chart.js, and Firebase SDK (v10.10.0), all loaded from CDNs.
*   **Inter-File Links:** Contains the same shared navigation menu as the other core files.
*   **Data Dependencies (Firebase):**
    *   **Reads:** It is the primary **consumer** of attendance data, reading from the `daily_attendance_reports` collection to generate visualizations. It also reads shared configuration data.

### 3. `quran-tracker.html` (Student Progress Tracker)

*   **Purpose:** A tool for managing individual student profiles and tracking their recitation progress.
*   **External Dependencies:** Tailwind CSS, Google Fonts, SheetJS (for Excel imports), and Firebase SDK (v11.6.1), all loaded from CDNs. *Note that this file uses a different Firebase SDK version than the other two.*
*   **Inter-File Links:** Contains the same shared navigation menu.
*   **Data Dependencies (Firebase):**
    *   **Reads and Writes:** It operates on its own distinct dataset, managing student profiles in the `students` collection and their progress in the `logs` collection.
    *   **Reads:** It reads the shared `class_definitions` and admin settings.

## Auxiliary Files

*   **`dashboard_backup.html`:** This appears to be a deprecated or backup version of `dashboard.html`. It is not linked from any active file and can be considered legacy code.
*   **`task_manager.html`:** This is a completely separate, standalone Kanban board application with its own Firebase configuration. It is functionally unrelated to the class-tracker application.

## Overall Architecture

The application is a serverless, static site where all logic is handled client-side in JavaScript embedded within each HTML file. The three core files are loosely coupled, sharing a navigation structure and some configuration data but operating on different primary datasets. The system relies entirely on CDNs for external dependencies, requiring no local build step.
